Chandrayaan-2 Mission Overview
Chandrayaan-2 is an Indian lunar mission designed to explore the Moon's south polar region, an area no country had visited before. The mission's goals were to improve the understanding of the Moon, demonstrate key technologies for deep-space missions, and inspire future generations of scientists and explorers.



The spacecraft was launched on 

July 22, 2019, aboard a Geosynchronous Satellite Launch Vehicle Mark-III (GSLV Mk-III). This three-stage vehicle is India's most powerful launcher, with a lift-off mass of 640 tonnes and a height of 43.43 m. The mission comprised three main modules: an 




Orbiter, the Vikram Lander, and the Pragyan Rover.

Orbiter
The Chandrayaan-2 Orbiter was designed to be placed in a 100x100 km lunar polar orbit with a mission life of one year. It is capable of communicating with both the Indian Deep Space Network (IDSN) at Byalalu and the Vikram lander. The Orbiter carries eight scientific instruments to study the Moon from above.
