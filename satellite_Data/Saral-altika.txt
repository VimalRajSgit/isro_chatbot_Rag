SARAL-AltiKa Mission

SARAL-AltiKa is a joint satellite mission between ISRO (Indian Space Research Organisation) and CNES (French Space Agency). Its primary objective is to study the ocean from space using a radar altimetry system and to promote the use of the ARGOS Data Collecting System.

The mission is a key part of the global altimetry system, providing data continuity from previous missions like TOPEX/Poseidon, the Jason series, and ENVISAT for the long-term monitoring of ocean circulation and sea-level changes.

Launch Details üöÄ
Launch Date: 2013-02-25

Launch Vehicle: PSLV-C20

Launch Site: Satish Dhawan Space Centre

Payload Instruments üõ∞Ô∏è
The satellite carries two main payloads:

AltiKa
Developed by: CNES (French Space Agency)

Type: Ka-band Radar Altimeter. It was the first oceanographic altimeter to use such a high frequency (35.75 GHz) with a bandwidth of 500 MHz.

Advantages: Provides more accurate measurements with improved spatial and vertical resolution. This enables better observation of ice, coastal areas, continental water bodies, and wave height.

Limitations: The Ka-band frequency is sensitive to rain, which can cause signal attenuation.

ARGOS
Type: A Data Collecting System used to collect data from various platforms.

Applications and Data Contribution
The data from SARAL-AltiKa supports a wide range of applications:

Meso-scale studies in the open ocean

Coastal area monitoring

Seasonal forecasting

Hydrology and climate studies

Development of operational oceanography

Data from the AltiKa instrument, combined with data from other altimetry missions, is crucial for improving climate understanding and forecasting. It's assimilated into various coupled ocean-atmosphere models and bio-chemistry models to enhance their predictive capabilities.
