{
  "mission_name": "SARAL-AltiKa",
  "collaboration": "A joint mission of ISRO (Indian Space Research Organisation) and CNES (French Space Agency).",
  "primary_objective": "To study the ocean from space using a radar altimetry system and to promote the maximum use of the ARGOS Data Collecting System.",
  "mission_context": "Part of the global altimetry system, providing continuity to data from missions like TOPEX/Poseidon, Jason series, and ENVISAT for long-term monitoring of ocean circulation and sea-level changes.",
  "payloads": [
    {
      "name": "AltiKa",
      "developed_by": "CNES",
      "type": "Ka-band Radar Altimeter",
      "specifications": {
        "frequency": "35.75 GHz",
        "bandwidth": "500 MHz",
        "significance": "The first oceanographic altimeter to use such a high frequency."
      },
      "advantages": "Provides more accurate measurements with improved spatial and vertical resolution, enabling better observation of ice, coastal areas, continental water bodies, and wave height.",
      "limitations": "The Ka-band frequency is sensitive to rain, which can lead to signal attenuation."
    },
